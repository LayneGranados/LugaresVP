This Interface Application Template uses a few libraries and classed from Open Source projects to work properly.
We've have tried our bests to include a license and a compact description of all the external libraries we have used.
If you believe we have missed something, don't bother to contact us at: crew@sherdle.com

 Used Resource: IOS7 Stroke Item font: 
 Integration: 	Some of the icons used in this template (~10) are flattened PNG files based on the Vectors from the 
 				IOS7 Stroke Item font.
 License:		The license of Pixeden allows us to use the flattened non-vector based icons in our Template.
 				You're also free to use these icons in your app, even without mentioning Pixeden (though I think they'd appreciate it).
